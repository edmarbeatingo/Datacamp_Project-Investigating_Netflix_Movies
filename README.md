# Datacamp_Project-Investigating_Netflix_Movies
Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Project Overview:
Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry.
You work for a production company that specializes in nostalgic styles. You want to do some research on movies released in the 1990's. You'll delve into Netflix data and perform exploratory data analysis to better understand this awesome movie decade!

Goal:
Perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.
1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration.
2. A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.
